A multiple disease predictor is a tool that uses machine learning algorithms to predict the presence or absence of multiple diseases based on patient data, such as medical records, imaging results, or genetic information. The predictor can be used for early diagnosis, risk assessment, and personalized treatment planning.

Patients often take tests at home or in laboratories and have to wait for the doctor’s appointment for an extended period. So with our application, patients can check their results at home. As well as the doctor can use it to check the accuracy of whether his predictions are correct.

**Steps to Install:**

1. Clone or download the repository.
   
2. Open the command prompt in the downloaded folder.
   
3. Create a virtual environment
   
----python -m venv venv
   
4. Install all the dependencies:
   
----pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run the application
   
----python app.py

Our model is trying to develop a system for five diseases: pneumonia, malaria, kidney, heart, and liver. The first two take image inputs and the rest take numeric inputs from the user. The algorithms we have used are CNN and random forest. We have obtained the accuracy of 96% and 95%.

Overall, a multiple disease predictor project aims to develop a machine-learning model that can assist clinicians in making accurate and personalized diagnoses and treatment plans for patients with various diseases. 

**Objectives:**

●	To develop a machine learning model using random forest and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms to accurately predict several diseases, including malaria, liver disease, kidney disease, heart disease, and pneumonia, using medical images.

●	To pre-process and augment the dataset to improve model performance and generalization.

●	To employ transfer learning techniques to leverage pre-trained models on large-scale image recognition tasks to improve the accuracy of our model.

●	To compare the performance of our model against existing state-of-the-art disease prediction models.

●	To integrate the model into the existing medical infrastructure, where doctors and other medical professionals can access it through a user-friendly interface.

●	To assist medical professionals in accurately diagnosing diseases, which can be challenging and time-consuming using traditional diagnostic methods, resulting in better healthcare outcomes for patients.

●	To reduce the time and cost associated with traditional diagnostic methods, making healthcare more accessible to individuals in need.
