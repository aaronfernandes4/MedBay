A multiple disease predictor is a tool that uses machine learning algorithms to predict the presence or absence of multiple diseases based on patient data, such as medical records, imaging results, or genetic information. The predictor can be used for early diagnosis, risk assessment, and personalized treatment planning.

Patients often take tests at home or in laboratories and have to wait for the doctor’s appointment for an extended period. So with our application, patients can check their own results at home. As well as the doctor can use it to check the accuracy of whether his predictions are correct.

Our model is trying to develop a system for five diseases: pneumonia, malaria, kidney, heart, and liver. The first two take image inputs and the rest take numeric inputs from the user. The algorithms we have used are CNN and random forest. We have obtained the accuracy of 96% and 95%.

Overall, a multiple disease predictor project aims to develop a machine-learning model that can assist clinicians in making accurate and personalized diagnoses and treatment plans for patients with various diseases.
